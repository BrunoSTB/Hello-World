# Hello-World

I am a 22 year old student, who is currently taking a System Analysis and Development course.
I'm also doing the CS50x, Harvard's course on Introduction to Computer Science.

New on coding, new on github.

Be nice :)


Edit 13/02/2023:
  A couple of years have passed, I'm now 24 yo, on my last semester of System Analysis and Development, and hoping to be promoted to Junior developer still this semester!
  
  Things are coming up really nice, and my github has had some improvement (even though it's still pretty simple).
 
 Feel free to explore my code and contact me!
